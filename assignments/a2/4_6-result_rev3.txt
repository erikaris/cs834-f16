peace be upon him allowed him to write down traditions after he hated that his companions should write anything else from him except the the allowed abdullah ibn amr to then the companions agreed on the value of recording traditions lest they should be lost or it seems that the prophet forbade writing his traditions was only in the beginning so that people would concentrate on the holy and lest it should mix with the once the quran was immune from any the prophet then allowed recording his abdullah ibn amr actually reported traditions from a number of senior companions like abu muath ibn suraqa ibn abder rahman ibn awf and he also reported stories from the people of the book the jews and the christians and spent lots of time studying their books and quoting them to tens of scholars transmitted traditions from abdullah ibn the scholars of traditions so much cared about the accuracy of the personalities of the companions and their various qualities that they even described how

gathered the quran and recited it all in one the messenger of god recite it in one i o messenger of let me use my strength and he read it in twenty i let me he then read it in seven i repeated the same but he it is that the prophet allowed him to read the quran in three nights and not less than this was in what had until then been revealed of the holy then the rest of it was inspired so it is not good to recite the quran in less than three for in that case a person will not be able to understand or contemplate what he if he would recite the quran regularly on a weekly that would be much better for islam is the religion of and a muslim has many worships to so that if he should read the quran in a few days he would not be able to establish those other he would not understand its
