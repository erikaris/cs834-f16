<p>Old Dominion University will dedicate its new stand-alone dining facility, the Kate and John R. Broderick Dining Commons, at a Sept. 23 event preceding Homecoming weekend.</p>

<p>The 39,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility, located at 1401 W. 49th Street, will have the capacity to seat 550 patrons inside and an additional 225 outside. It is scheduled to open on Oct. 12.</p>

<p>The dining commons was named for President John R. Broderick and First Lady Kate Broderick at the request of student leaders, for spearheading inclusion initiatives and to recognize their commitment to student success.<br /></p>


<p>Anyone interested in attending the 4 p.m. building dedication - that will include guided tours of the facility - is asked to RSVP by Sept. 21 at <a href="http://odu.imodules.com/bco16">http://odu.imodules.com/bco16</a> or by calling 757-683-3116.</p>

<p>The dining commons will provide a restaurant-style environment featuring a diverse array of options while creating a strong sense of community for students, faculty and staff of the University.</p>

<p>The main dining area will feature eight distinct restaurant-style options. They include:</p>

<ul><li>Bud's American Classics: classic dishes that exude regional comfort;</li>
<li>Maize South American Kitchen: Brazilian-style steakhouse with a churrasco grill and rotisserie;</li>
<li>Evoo Italian Cuisine: gourmet thin-crust pizza and other traditionally prepared specialties;</li>
<li>Rice Sticks Asian Kitchen: high-top noodle bar, hibachi grill and daily featured hot wok entrees</li>
<li>Uno Mas Fresh Mexican Flavors: made from scratch entrees, tortillas and salsa bar</li>
<li>Mosaic International: tapas (or small plate) selections from around the world;</li>
<li>350 Degrees Baked Goods: pies, cakes, cookies, doughnuts and bread made by in-house pastry chefs and bakers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer-facing food preparation areas will include window views into the Noodle Room and Butcher Room. A separate service window in the Rotunda will provide convenient access to pastries, coffee and cappuccino without having to enter the restaurant area.</p>

<p>Additionally, the dining commons is being constructed with sustainability in mind. It will be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold Certified and will meet specified standards relating to efficiencies in building materials, energy consumption, water conservation and overall environmental impact.</p>

<p>In response to the student-led initiative, Old Dominion's Board of Visitors voted unanimously in June to name the facility in honor of President John R. Broderick and First Lady Kate Broderick.</p>

<p>Student leaders representing many areas of campus life including the Student Government Association, NAACP and athletics met with Rector Ron Ripley to express their appreciation for the student success and inclusion initiatives spearheaded by the President and First Lady, said Ellen Neufeldt, vice president for student engagement and enrollment services.</p>

<p>&quot;It was noted that the Brodericks go above and beyond for students each and every day,&quot; Neufeldt said. &quot;The students wanted to do something significant for the Brodericks and felt that naming a building in their honor was a special way to say thank you.&quot;</p>
