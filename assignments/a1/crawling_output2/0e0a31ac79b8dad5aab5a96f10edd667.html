<p>Emily Eddins, PhD, is the Assistant Director for Leadership &amp; Student Involvement and is charged with creating and developing ODU's service-learning initiative. Specifically, she facilitates the integration of community-based opportunities into academic course curriculum across the university. She works closely with ODU faculty, staff, students, and diverse community organizations to provide students with integrative learning opportunities that connect the themes and theories of the coursework to tangible community-based work that enriches communities by addressing key community issues and needs. She also supervises the wonderful staff of the Center for Service &amp; Civic Engagement, housed in the Office of Leadership &amp; Student Involvement.</p>

There she received a fellowship from Center for Collaborative Conservation, which allowed her to do her research on international service-learning in rural Panama. She chose to work in service-learning because of its complexity, global-local significance, and the belief that collaborative processes between universities and surrounding communities can enact real social and environmental change. Emily loves the outdoors and retreats to the mountains to hike and camp as much as she can. When she can't get to the mountains, she enjoys exploring Norfolk while walking her dogs, cooking, and knitting.</p>

<p><strong>Service-Learning in ODU 2014-2019 Strategic Plan</strong></p>

<p>Service-learning is a key component of ODU 2014-2019 Strategic Plan, specifically contributing to <em>Goal 4: Engage with the greater community through social, intellectual and cultural activities:</em></p>

<p>&quot;Service-learning at Old Dominion University is a teaching and learning strategy that integrates meaningful community service, both locally and through study abroad programs, with central course themes in ways that promote reflection, teach civic responsibility, and strengthen communities. These courses directly involve students in community-based projects, usually centered on social justice. Through this intentional integration of university learning environments with community-based initiatives, service-learning shapes both students and communities in a variety of ways. In Academic Year 2014, Old Dominion University students logged more than 360,000 volunteer hours as part of the University's culture of service. The University's commitment has been recognized by inclusion in the U.S. President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll and the intention is to remain at the forefront of service learning and volunteerism&quot; (Old Dominion University 2014-2019 Strategic Plan, p. 49).</p>

<p><strong>Why include service-learning in your course?</strong></p>

<p><em>Best practices of service-learning include:</em></p>

<p>1) Integration of academic concepts with the service experience,</p>

<p>2) Reciprocal relationship building with the community partner(s), and</p>

<p>3) Engaging students in ongoing critical reflection of student experiences for effective learning.</p>

<p><em>Promote Your Service-Learning Course</em></p>

<p>Would you like your service-learning course to be listed for students on the ODU website and designated in the Course Catalog? A goal for ODU service-learning is to compile a comprehensive list of courses to support the promotion, recognition, and understanding of service-learning at ODU. If you would like your course to be included in this list, please send to Dr. Emily Eddins (eeddins@odu.edu):</p>

<p>1) Course Number and Title</p>

<p>2) Course Description as appears in the ODU Course Catalog</p>

<p>3) A brief description (2-3 sentences) of the service-learning component of the course and how the course fulfills the above three best practices of service-learning.</p>

<p><em>Service-Learning Student Course Evaluation</em></p>

<p>A Service-Learning Course Evaluation is available for distribution to your students when they complete your course. The survey is based on a template that is administered at universities around the country, so we'll be able to look at responses from our students and those at other universities, as well as strengthen and tailor service-learning in particular areas based on results.</p>

<p>When implementing service-learning, there are many questions that arise and choices to be made when planning and managing service-learning in your course. This session will guide you in creating a roadmap for service-learning and provide tools to manage potential ambiguity and challenges when sending students to work with community agencies and organizations.</p>

<p><strong>What is &quot;Service&quot; in Service-Learning? Best Practice in Service-Learning<br /> </strong>February 24, 2015 Gornto 217, 12:30 - 1:30PM</p>

<p>What do we mean by &quot;service&quot; in service-learning? Service-learning is integrated in syllabi across the curriculum, from biology to accounting to engineering to geography and beyond. Each discipline customizes the basic tenets of service-learning to fit course content and community need, and therefore impacts students in diverse and unique ways. In this session, we discuss best practice in service-learning and provide tools to effectively connect the &quot;service&quot; with the &quot;learning&quot; in your curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>The 21st Century Model: Community Collaboration and Co-education in Service-Learning<br /> </strong>March 24, 2015 Gornto 217, 12:30 - 1:30PM</p>

<p>As faculty at a major metropolitan university, our myriad of community partners and potential for collaboration and impact in our community are seemingly limitless. With a focus on collaboration and co-education by faculty and partners to maximize impact and student learning outcomes, this session will provide tools to develop, manage, and strengthen community-based and interdepartmental partnerships for service-learning.</p>

<p><strong>Planning for the Fall: Redesigning Curriculum for Service-Learning<br /> </strong>April 28, 2015 Gornto 217, 12:30 - 1:30PM</p>

<p>The goal of this session is to insure that your curriculum exemplifies the service-learning basic tenets for a meaningful and impactful course. We will review logistics, timelines, effective critical reflection techniques, partnership development, student learning, and making the most of service-learning as you design curriculum for your service-learning course in the fall.</p>

Compassion is direclty linked to <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/feeling-it/201211/the-best-kept-secret-happiness-health-compassion">happiness</a>. Many cite volunteerism as a great way to gain employable skills, network, and socialize.</p>

<p>It's also a great way to make friends! There are many reasons to volunteer - maybe you volunteer because:</p>

<p> You like that warm, fuzzy feeling you get from serving others</p>

<p> You like gaining employable skills</p>

<p> You like checking that service requirement off your organization's list</p>

<p>No matter the reason you serve, there is no doubt that you are creating meaningful impact.</p>

<div class="tab-content section">
<p><strong>Find your best volunteer work</strong></p>

<p>Have you ever found yourself volunteering just because a friend or family member invited you to join in? Or your neighborhood, church, or synagogue planned an event, and you wanted to do your part? This type of &quot;spontaneous&quot; volunteering is a wonderful thing, and lots of important community work gets accomplished this way. But you may also be seeking volunteer work on behalf of a cause in which you believe. You may be willing to make a longer-term commitment so that you can see positive change. Because there are so many worthwhile causes to support, and because service organizations are often complex, begin your search by doing some self-evaluation:</p>

<ul><li>What need or problem concerns you enough to give your time to it?</li>
<li>There may be many social issues that worry you. Which ones are priorities for you?</li>
<li>Do you know what organizations address these issues in your community?</li>
<li>Do you think they are doing a good job and deserve your support?</li>
<li>Or are you concerned about a cause that no one else seems to be tackling?</li>
<li>Are you willing to be the founder of a new effort?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What skills do you have to offer? What types of things are you very good at (and like to do)?</strong></p>

<p>These can be professional skills that you apply in your paying job or hobbies that might be applicable to a community agency. Almost every type of skill is needed somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>What would you like to learn by volunteering?</strong></p>

<p>As a volunteer, you have the freedom to experiment with new activities. Is there something you wish you had the opportunity to learn? Some organizations will gladly assign you to something out of your normal area of expertise because they know that you will be motivated by tackling something new. This is one way that volunteering is &quot;recreational.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>How much time do you want to give?</strong><br /><br /> Before you seek volunteer work, thing about your time availability. The people for whom you volunteer will need to know that they can count on you to maintain your scheduled commitment. It may be better to start with a limited number of hours of volunteer work and later expand your schedule, rather than promising many more hours than you can actually give.</p>

<p><strong>What are you sure you do not want to do?</strong></p>

<p>It is OK to identify certain things you want to avoid as you volunteer. The happier you are about what you will be doing, the better volunteering you will perform. So don't feel that you have to say &quot;yes&quot; to any assignment offered. Feel free to negotiate. Looking for volunteer work is very much like looking for a paying job-only better! Expect volunteering to be a fun way to spend your valuable time, with the added benefit of helping others.</p>

<p>When it comes to volunteerism, we do not believe it is necessary to &quot;reinvent the wheel.&quot; Based on best practices from other nonprofits and volunteer centers, your agency can create a successful volunteer program by simply remembering the 3 R's: Recruit, Retain, &amp; Recognize!</p>

 


        </div></div>
<div class="tab-content section"><h3><a href="#">Recruit</a></h3><div class="padded">
            
<p><strong>Two Types of Volunteer Recruitment</strong></p>

<ol><li>&quot;Warm body&quot; recruitment - A more foolproof source of volunteers<p>If you are doing a large one-time service project that requires little to no training or commitment, then you would need &quot;warm body&quot; recruitment. These volunteers are able to drop in, serve, and leave. These volunteers can usually come from the general public and the project does not require that the volunteers have any special skills or traits.</p>
<p>Examples of this include: one-time playground cleanup and volunteering at an annual weekend festival.</p>
</li>
<li>Targeted recruitment - A source of more foolproof volunteers<p>If you are looking for more long-term, committed volunteers, then you would need targeted recruitment. These are the volunteers you need to take more time to recruit and train more in depth. They might special skills or traits more specific to the type of volunteer work. This type of volunteer recruitment usually takes longer to plan out and to implement, but it is well worth it to have dedicated and qualified volunteers to a long-term service project at your agency.</p>
<p>Examples of this include: mentoring at an after school program and volunteering in a weekly community garden.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How to Recruit Volunteers</strong></p>

<ul><li>Think about your target volunteer.<ul><li>What type of volunteer are you looking for? Do you need a certain age, special skill, etc.?</li>
<li>&quot;Volunteer&quot; is not a positive word to everyone. Sometimes words like &quot;volunteer&quot; and &quot;community service&quot; conjure up images of forced, court-ordered roadside trash pickup. While many people enjoy volunteering and studies indicate that service has many benefits, many potential volunteers are not aware of this yet.</li>
<li>Volunteer incentives, such as free food, t-shirts, or SWAG can help recruit volunteers, but the incentives you choose depend on the type of volunteer you need.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a successful marketing campaign.<ul><li>The number one reason people volunteer is because they were asked!</li>
<li>Traditional fliers hung up around town</li>
<li>Ads in the newspaper</li>
<li>Social media: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notify your local volunteer center of your upcoming project at least two weeks in advance to allow for ample time to recruit using that method.</li>
</ul>

 


        </div></div>
<div class="tab-content section"><h3><a href="#">Retain</a></h3><div class="padded">
            
<p><strong>Two Main Reasons Agencies Lose Their Volunteers</strong></p>

<ol><li>They don't feel appreciated.</li>
<li>They don't feel like it is a good use of their time.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>How to Retain Volunteers</strong><br /></p>

<ul><li>Volunteers need to feel that their skills are being used in a meaningful way.</li>
<li>The place of service meets their skills and interests (not all accountants or nurses want to volunteer as accountants or nurses).</li>
<li>Volunteer orientations are essential to every long-term volunteer program, because it creates &quot;buy-in&quot; for a volunteer who is not getting paid. Volunteer orientations should include at least: o A brief history of the organization o Explain the mission to the volunteers and how their volunteerism is tied into the mission. Even sweeping the floors can help an organization achieve its mission!</li>
<li>&quot;Responsible&quot; vs. &quot;Have to&quot; - Remember - volunteers are giving of themselves to your organization, so it is always best to lean towards creating an environment that makes volunteers feel &quot;responsible&quot; for their volunteer efforts rather than feeling like they &quot;have to.&quot; They are more likely to respond if they know someone is relying on them rather than feeling like they have to be someone is making them.</li>
</ul>

 


        </div></div>
<div class="tab-content section"><h3><a href="#">Recognize</a></h3><div class="padded">
            
<p>When volunteers receive feedback and see how their efforts are making a difference, they are more likely to continue to stay dedicated with your agency.</p>

<p><strong>How to Recruit Volunteers</strong></p>

<ul><li>Daily recognition can provide positive reinforcement to the regular volunteers at your organization.<ul><li>Say &quot;Thank You&quot; ... Again, they are not free labor</li>
<li>Daily or regular recognition gives your volunteers a reason to come back</li>
<li>Treat them the same way as regular staff (within your limits, of course)</li>
<li>Celebrate the volunteer's anniversary with the organization</li>
<li>Send an email or card thanking your volunteers (if ongoing) when they join</li>
<li>Send an email saying thank you and include a survey (their feedback is valued)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intermittent recognition can make a volunteer feel special and valued at your organization.<ul><li>Nominate them as Volunteer Superstars with Volunteer Starkville.</li>
<li>Send their information to local news outlets. Starkville Daily News has a weekly piece about community members who make a difference.</li>
<li>Create a Volunteer of the Month/Year/Etc. program and highlight their good works within your organization.</li>
<li>Give them more responsibilities. Remember, volunteers need to feel responsible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Significant recognition can make a volunteer feel like an essential part of your organization, which they are!<ul><li>Make special t-shirts or plaques or other tangible items.</li>
<li>Offer tuition assistance.</li>
<li>Involve them in the planning process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
