<p>A candidate for  the   doctoral degree in computer science must meet all of the following requirements in addition to the University requirements outlined in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://catalog.odu.edu/graduate/">Graduate Catalog</a>.
</p>
<ol><li>Pass the Ph.D. qualifying process that consists of breadth oral examination, research ability oral examination, and  advanced course requirement.</li>
<li>a minimum of 72 credit hours beyond the bachelor’s degree and 48 credit hours beyond the master’s degree.</li>
<li>Pass the candidacy examination.</li>
<li>Attend at least 10 colloquiums - see <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cs.odu.edu/~ibl/colloqreq.htm">Colloquium Requirements</a> for more information.</li>
<li>Successfully defend the dissertation.</li></ol>
<p>The above must be completed within eight years after admission to the Ph.D.  program. Note that students with a degree in a discipline outside of computer science will be required to take prerequisite undergraduate courses that will not be counted towards the 72 credit hours requirement. 
</p><p><b>Advisor.</b> Upon admission to the Ph.D. program, a faculty advisor will be assigned to the student for general guidance. The student, however, is expected to find a dissertation advisor by the time he or she completes the qualifying process.
</p><p><br /> 
</p><p><b>Course Requirements.</b> Students with a master’s degree in computer science must complete course work as specified below:
</p>
 <ol><li>A minimum of 24 hours of post-master's coursework at 800-level.  </li>
 <li>Complete the dissertation work of 24 credit hours or more.</li>
 <li>A maximum of six hours may be transferred into the Ph.D. program from post-master’s coursework done elsewhere.</li></ol>
<p>Students with an undergraduate degree in computer science must complete course work as specified below:
</p>
<ol><li>12 credit hours of core coursework approved by the GPD from a list of courses such as: CS 550, 555, 517, 600, and 665</li>
 <li>A minimum of 36 credit hours of course work at 600-level or above of which at least 24 credit hours must be at 800-level. </li>
 <li>Complete the dissertation work of 24 credit hours or more.</li></ol>
<p>Students with an undergraduate or master’s degree in a discipline outside computer science must complete the 72 credit hours of course work as specified above. Additionally, these students need to demonstrate proficiency in Problem Solving &amp; Programming, Introduction to Computer Architecture, Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms, Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science, and Operating Systems at an undergraduate level.
</p><p><b>Research Guidance Committee.</b> A research guidance committee will be formed after the student has passed the breadth oral examination of the PhD qualifying process. 
</p>
<ul><li> The duties of a research guidance committee are:<br />

<ol>
<li>To advise the student on the course preparation, in<br /> particular to
help draw a plan of study</li>
<li>To help define the research area of the student.</li>
<li>To prepare and administer the candidacy exam.</li>
</ol>
<li> A research guidance committee is formed according to the following
procedure:
<br />
<ol>
<li>The student finds a regular faculty advisor. Note that a regular faculty advisor can be different from the temporary faculty advisor
assigned to the student upon admission to the Ph.D. program. </li>
<li> The advisor selects the members of the research guidance committee
in cooperation with  the student and the graduate studies
committee.</li>
<li>  The research guidance committee consists of at least three ODU faculty members.  At least two of these must be from the Computer Science Department and one <i>may</i> be from outside the Computer Science Department.  All committee members must be certified for graduate instruction.
The current research interests
of the computer science members of the committee should be related
to the research goals of the student.</li>
<li> Additional members may be appointed to the committee.</li>
<li> The committee must fill a
Ph.D. Guidance Committee Form (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://ww2.odu.edu/ao/gradstudies/forms/">http://ww2.odu.edu/ao/gradstudies/forms/</a>). 
This form is  submitted to
the graduate  program director by the graduate studies 
committee and to the dean of  the school for approval.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<p><b>Candidacy Examination.</b> Upon completing coursework, before becoming heavily involved in dissertation work, and no later than three years after acceptance into the Ph.D. program (preferably during the first 18 months after admission into the program), the student must pass a candidacy examination. This examination is designed to test the student’s knowledge of background material related to the dissertation topic and to determine if the student has identified a significant problem, has a plan of attack and is ready to proceed with the dissertation research.
</p><p>At least one week before the scheduled examination time (and preferably two weeks before), the student must provide the examination committee with a dissertation research proposal. The proposal should contain the following items (not necessarily in this order):
</p>
<ul><li> a comprehensive literature review on the dissertation topic that should in particular discuss limitations of current approaches and open problems in the topic area
</li><li> a description of the research problem
</li><li> a discussion of how the problem relates to other work in the field
</li><li> a detailed research plan, including proposed tasks and a timeline for completion
</li><li> a list of expected contributions
</li></ul>
<p>During the examination, the student will give a 45-minute presentation of the proposal to be followed by questions from the committee. The exam is expected to last no more than 2 hours.
</p><p>The presentation of the proposal is open to the public and will be publicized by the GPD at least one week in advance of the exam. Once the presentation has concluded and the audience has asked general questions, the audience will be excused. The examination by the committee will be held in private, but any graduate faculty member is welcome to observe the exam.
</p><p>The defense is chaired by the chair of the research guidance committee (student’s advisor). The chair will act as moderator, ruling on questions of procedure and protocol that may arise during the examination.
</p><p><b>Dissertation Committee.</b> After the candidacy exam has been passed and dissertation topic approved, the research guidance committee's responsibilities are completed. 
A new committee, the dissertation committee, is formed to supervise the dissertation research. 
</p><p>A dissertation committee is formed according to the following procedure: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>The faculty advisor selects the members of the dissertation committee in cooperation with the student and the graduate studies committee.</li>
<li>The dissertation committee consists of at least three ODU faculty members.  At least two of these must be from the Computer Science Department and one <i>must</i> be from outside the Computer Science Department.  All committee members must be certified for graduate instruction.
The current research interests
of the computer science members of the committee should be related
to the research goals of the student.</li>
<li> Additional members may be appointed to the committee. Adjuncts (approved for graduate instruction) and non-university members may be added with approval of the GPD.</li>
<li>The committee must fill a Ph.D. Dissertation Committee Form (<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.odu.edu/graduatestudies/Forms">http://www.odu.edu/graduatestudies/Forms</a>). This form is submitted to the graduate program director by the graduate studies committee and to the dean of the school for approval.</li>
<li>The associate vice president for research and graduate studies is an ex-officio member of all dissertation committees.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
<b>Dissertation.</b> A minimum of 24 credit hours of dissertation work is 				required. The work must represent an achievement in research and must be a significant contribution in the field. Students are required to publish (or have in the revision process) at least one paper in a refereed journal or refereed conference proceedings based on their dissertation work.
</p><p><br />
<b>Dissertation Defense.</b> The examination will be oral and the examination 				committee must have the completed dissertation at least two weeks before the examination date. In addition to the examination, students are required to give a public oral presentation on their dissertation results.
</p><p><br />
<b>Time Requirement.</b> Ph.D. students should normally be full time. A full-time student can be expected to satisfy all the Ph.D. requirements in three to four years when entering with an M.S. degree  or four to five years with a baccalaureate degree. No student (full-time or part-time) will be allowed to 	study for the Ph.D. degree beyond eight years from the date of admission into the program.
</p><p>For example, an aggressive timeline for a full-time student entering with an M.S. degree and no prerequisite requirements may look like this.
</p>
<pre>
End of 6 months:	Pass the breadth oral examination
End of 12 months:	Pass the research ability examination
End of 18 months:	Successfully complete the coursework requirements
End of 18 months:	Pass the candidacy examination
End of 36 months:	Successfully defend the dissertation
</pre>
<p>For the same student, a normal timeline may look like this.
</p>
<pre>
End of 6 months:	Pass the breadth oral examination
End of 12 months:	Pass the research ability examination
End of 18 months:	Successfully complete the coursework requirements
End of 24 months:	Pass the candidacy examination
End of 48 months:	Successfully defend the dissertation
</pre>
